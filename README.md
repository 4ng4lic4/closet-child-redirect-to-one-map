# How it works 
In order to the extension to work properly you need to be logged into your One Map account in the browser session you intend to use it in.\
The extension adds a button on every product's page on [ClosetChild Online Shop](https://www.closetchildonlineshop.com/). Clicking the button opens a new tab which redirects to One Map price request. Said page will have the *Item URL*, *Item Name* and *Quantity* fields filled in. Other fields are not required to ask for the price quote, so all that's left to request it is to click the **Request a price quote** button.

# Installation
1. Enter [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in a new tab.
2. Before attempting to load the extension make sure to have **Developer Mode** enabled (if it's not enabled you can do it by clicking the toggle next to **Developer Mode** and **refresh the page**).
3. Locate the `closet-child-redirect-to-one-map-extension` folder on your machine.
4. Drag-drop the folder onto **Extensions** page.
